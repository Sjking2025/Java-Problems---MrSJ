868. Binary Gap

Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.
Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's). The distance between two 1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.


Example 1:
-----------
Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.

Example 2:
----------
Input: n = 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.

Example 3:
-----------
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 109

Proposed Solution Flow (VERIFIED ✔):
------------------------
1️⃣ Declare a variable maxDistance to store the maximum gap.

2️⃣ Convert the given number n into binary representation.

3️⃣ Count the number of 1s.

    👉 If there are fewer than two 1s → return 0.

4️⃣ Store the binary digits in an array (or treat as sequence of bits).

5️⃣ Iterate through the binary bits from left to right.

6️⃣ Find the first occurrence of 1.

7️⃣ From that position, look for the next occurrence of 1.

8️⃣ When the next 1 is found:

    Compute distance using bit positions.

            Distance = current index − previous index.

9️⃣ Compare the computed distance with maxDistance.

   👉 If greater → update maxDistance.

10️⃣ Move forward and repeat the process for every consecutive pair of 1s.

11️⃣ After scanning all bits, return maxDistance.

📌 validation rules
✔ If fewer than two 1s → return 0
✔ Use bit indexes to compute distance
✔ Only compare consecutive 1s
✔ Keep updating maximum distance
